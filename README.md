Title: Investigating the impact of Hurricane Hugo on Stream Chemistry data in Luquillo

Contributors: Josh, Yos, Takeen, Brooke

The purpose of this analysis is to compare and reproduce hurricane data visualizations at 4 different sites from Journal of Tropical Ecology. The goal is to use the data of chemical level and improve the plots that are used in this research article to better analyze the effects of Hurricane Hugo from 1988 to 1994. 

Additionally, our data exploration brought us to the following question: 
Do we see similar changes in chemical concentration with other tropical storms in the area from 1990 to 1993.
